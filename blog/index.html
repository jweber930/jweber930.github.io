                        Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.
                        Just my luck, no ice.
                        I was part of something special.
                        My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you.
                        Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
                        Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?
                        Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.
                        Is this my espresso machine?
                        Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
                        Forget the fat lady!
                        You're obsessed with the fat lady!
                        Drive us out of here!
                        Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
